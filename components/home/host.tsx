          <p className="abpout_text px-0 px-md-5">
            <span className="d-block">Anjit Suhag is an accomplished yoga instructor who has trained approximately 200,000 people in
              yoga over the course of 2-3 years. His fitness journey began in 2017 as a runner, and his love for fitness has only grown since then.</span>
            <span className="d-block mt-md-3 mt-3">In 2020, Anjit discovered the practice of Mudgar and began to learn it. During his journey, he
              realized that there were issues with the way Mudgar was being taught. Many people were
              unaware of this ancient art, and those who were aware were charging exorbitant amounts for the
              practice and selling Mudgars at unaffordable prices.</span>
            <span className="d-block mt-md-3 mt-3">Anjit decided to start his own teaching journey, making the practice of Mudgar more accessible
              and affordable. He began to manufacture and sell premium quality Mudgars made of Mahaghani
              wood at a reasonable price.</span>
            <span className="d-block mt-md-3 mt-3">This gave Anjit a purpose to start his Har-Ghar Mudgar journey, where he aims to teach Mudgar
              to every household and spread this practice as far as possible.</span>
            <span className="d-block mt-md-3 mt-3">The course is a part of Anjit's mission, and he hopes to make this ancient practice accessible to
              all.</span>
