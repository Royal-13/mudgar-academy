    "bio": [
      "Anjit Suhag is an accomplished yoga instructor who has trained approximately 200,000 people in yoga over the course of 2-3 years. His fitness journey began in 2017 as a runner, and his love for fitness has only grown since then.",
      "In 2020, Anjit discovered the practice of Mudgar and began to learn it. During his journey, he realized that there were issues with the way Mudgar was being taught. Many people were unaware of this ancient art, and those who were aware were charging exorbitant amounts for the practice and selling Mudgars at unaffordable prices.",
      "Anjit decided to start his own teaching journey, making the practice of Mudgar more accessible and affordable. He began to manufacture and sell premium quality Mudgars made of Mahaghani wood at a reasonable price. This gave Anjit a purpose to start his Har-Ghar Mudgar journey, where he aims to teach Mudgar to every household and spread this practice as far as possible."
